I am currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by Prof. [Xin Jin](https://xinjin.github.io/) and Prof. [Xuanzhe Liu](http://www.liuxuanzhe.com/).

My research interests include machine learning systems, distributed storage, and smartNICs, with a recent focus on system for large language models (LLMs).

I received my B.S. degree in computer science from the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Peking University in 2023.
